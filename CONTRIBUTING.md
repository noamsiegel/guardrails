# Contributing to ai-git-guardrails

Thanks for improving `ai-git-guardrails`. This repo is a user-owned security and quality layer; keep changes portable, explicit, and hostile-repo-aware.

## How to report a bug

Open a [bug report](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md) with reproduction steps, expected behavior, actual behavior, and your environment.

## How to propose a feature

## Development setup

`ai-git-guardrails` is a portable lefthook config plus bash helpers for cross-repo personal hooks.

Dependencies:

```bash
brew install bash yq actionlint gitleaks lefthook
bun install -g @commitlint/cli
bun install
```

Use the local checkout as a hook fixture when possible; avoid weakening user-level checks based on repo-local configuration.

## Running tests

```bash
bun test tests/ai-git-guardrails.test.ts
```

## Commit message format

Conventional Commits are recommended but not strictly required:

```text
fix: defend gitleaks config from repo allowlists
feat: add doctor check for hook overrides
```
